# Voice Menubar Scaffold

Minimal Tauri v2 + React + TypeScript skeleton for a macOS menu bar utility.

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev` starts the Vite frontend.
- `pnpm build` creates the frontend production bundle.
- `cargo tauri dev` runs the full desktop app with the tray/menubar scaffold.

## Notes

- Target platform is macOS only.
- Rust service modules are scaffolded under `src-tauri/src/` with stubs only.
