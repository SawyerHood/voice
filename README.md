# Voice

A personal voice-to-text desktop app — your own WhisperFlow / SuperWhisper / Monologue.

## Development

Work is coordinated via swarm agents:
- **Worker agents** (`codex-app`) handle implementation in git worktrees under `~/worktrees`.
- **Merger agent** merges completed branches into `main`.

## Setup

```bash
# TODO: fill in once stack is chosen
```
